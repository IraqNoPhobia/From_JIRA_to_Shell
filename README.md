# Reverse shell from JIRA
Since I haven't found any well explained articles on how to get reverse shell from JIRA web application server, I thought it could be a good idea to cover this subject with the pentesters community.

JIRA Software is a powerful platform that combines issue collection and agile project management capabilities into a single application. Using JIRA helps you plan and organize tasks, workflows, and reports for your agile team more efficiently.  
  
I've seen many environment in my career where the JIRA web application is installed without or with poor credentials which maybe some admins ignore the fact that we can get remote code execution on this web app.

Usually, JIRA servers are configured by default to run on port 8080 but I've seen many times where the bind port was changed to 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS). For discovering what is on the LAN, I would choose masscan available on the link below:

Let's say that you are inside a local area network with the subnet *192.168.255.0* and your local IP address is *192.168.123.45* and wish to perform a complete network scan to discover those JIRA servers. The syntax for running masscan I would use would be:  
```
./masscan 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 -p80,443,8080 -oL JIRA.where-are-you.txt --max-rate 10000 --open --banners -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
```  
After masscan finished scanning the LAN, you will see output results inside of the file *JIRA.where-are-you.txt*. JIRA should look like this in your web browser:

You are probably saying OK, I'm logged in on JIRA, now what? You have to know that JIRA supports the *Groovy* language. Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional programming.
